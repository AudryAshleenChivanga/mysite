# My Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal website. I'm Audry Ashleen Chivanga, and this is where I share my journey as a software engineering student, founder, and someone passionate about using tech to solve real problems in Africa.

## What This Is

This is my digital space where I showcase:
- My work at Zipline Rwanda (working on drone perception systems)
- My startup Mediqueueless (reducing patient waiting times in African hospitals)
- My experiences from the Silicon Valley Global Leadership Program
- Research I've done with Deep Learning Indaba and National Geographic
- The various leadership programs I've been part of

Basically, it's my story told through code and design.

## The Tech Stack

I built this with:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - keeping it simple and fast
- **Flask** - for the backend server and contact form
- **Python** - for handling email submissions

Nothing too fancy, just clean code that works well and looks good.

## Running It Locally

If you want to check it out on your machine:

### Quick Start
```bash
python server.py
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

The server handles:
- Serving the website
- Processing contact form submissions
- Sending emails (if you configure it - see EMAIL_SETUP.md)

### Just Viewing the Site
You can also just open `index.html` directly in your browser, though some features work better with the server running.

## What's Inside

```
mysite/
├── index.html          # The main website
├── styles.css          # All the styling (dark theme with gold accents)
├── script.js           # Interactive features and animations
├── server.py           # Flask server for contact form
├── images/             # Photos from my journey
└── EMAIL_SETUP.md      # Instructions for setting up email
```

## Features I'm Proud Of

- **Dark, elegant design** - I wanted something that felt professional but also warm
- **Responsive** - works on everything from phones to big screens
- **Contact form** - actually sends emails to me (when configured)
- **Gallery** - photos from Silicon Valley, conferences, and other experiences
- **Smooth animations** - because who doesn't love a bit of polish?

## My Story Highlights

This site tells the story of:
- Being selected as 1 of 14 students for the Silicon Valley Global Leadership Program
- Founding Mediqueueless to tackle healthcare wait times
- Working with Zipline on autonomous drone systems
- Research that got accepted at the International Deep Learning Conference
- Being a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at ALU

## Why I Built This

I wanted a space that truly represents who I am and what I'm working on. Not just a resume, but a story. A place where people can see not just what I've done, but why it matters to me.

Building technology that transforms lives across Africa isn't just a tagline for me - it's what drives everything I do. From Mediqueueless to my work at Zipline, it's all connected by that mission.
